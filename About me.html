    <h1>Education</h1>
    <p>Formal education typically begins in early childhood with preschool or kindergarten and 
        continues through primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. It usually follows a structured curriculum 
        and involves certified educators guiding students through learning activities.
         However, education isn't limited to formal institutions. Informal education occurs outside traditional classroom settings through experiences,
          interactions, and self-directed learning.</p>
          <p>Am currently persueing my education career at Zindua school kenya where am doing software development</p>
